Origin of Cozy
Jacky and Andy have been talking about a web3-minded cafe for more than 2 years. Andy is co-founder/designer of famous cafe “CHILV” who knows the ins and outs of managing a cafe business. We never found the right timing and bandwidth to take on this side quest. 

A recent opportunity came around when Stella, who was a store manager from Truffle’s Living (Jacky’s favorite cafe) wanted to do her own cafe. The partnership was formed. Stella brings in the on the ground operational experience and staffing, Jacky brings in the community, network, and funding, and Andy as an advisor brings in the cafe ownership experience and exceptional branding expertise.

We believe the strength of the cafe is in its community, and physical space is the magic to building successful communities. So we wanted to find the best community organizers to bring their community including podcast community / BZD / Web3 / g0v / StartUp founders / Digital Nomads…etc. The more people we get involved, the more interesting and fun this project will be when more worlds’ collide.
